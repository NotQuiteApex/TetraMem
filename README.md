This was a game I made for my Psychology class to demonstrate the idea of sensory memory. Don't treat it as scientific fact, but it gives a general idea as to how sensory memory works.

This game/program/software/what-have-you makes use of the 7 colors used in the tetramino blocks from the game/program/software/what-have-you known as Tetris, organizes them into a "pattern" and using sensory memory of what was shown on screen for a second or less, you have to correctly guess which "pattern" matches the one that was just shown.

The code isn't documented very well, but its all in one file and relatively not very long.
